    			<p>		We code every day.</p>
			    	<p>		Which is interesting.  It gets quiet and kind of empty.  The room buzzes and there is a drum beat, irregular and syncopated.  Tick.  Ticky tack.  The keyboards talk more than anything.  Clip, click chirp.  Sometimes it is staccato.  Sometimes it is silent and the air in the room presses close, smells slightly of industrial cleaner.  The conversations are hardiy ever loud, which adds an intensity to them.  Whispered in some corner, something deeper happening but not expressed.  Each keystroke a grain, gathered into piles.  Swept under the rug.  Filling boxes, buckets, every container that was empty now full, sand spilling on the floor, gathering in piles.  Arranged neatly in rows.</p>

					<p>		Sometimes there are breaks.  We stand and talk about our feelings, which seems to bother people for some reason.  Why do our feelings matter? Is this a test?  I'm not afraid of anything! Can’t we just code, get on with it.  Move forward and follow directions like good little ants.</p>

					<p>		We code like this and then... </p>

    			<p>		We got a whiteboard today and surprisingly, it was very loud.</p>  
			    	<p>		Not the whiteboard itself, although that would have been interesting.</p>
			    	<p>		Hammer drills ripping up the brick facing on the side of the wall.  Turning compressed, heated mud into so much dust.  Then a bit of talk about bits and screws and such and there, a plain reusable writing surface.</p>
			    	<p>		The whiteboard is empty now and the other walls have been colonized by little cities of ideas, brainstorms from the start of class, concepts that we need to know, memorize, take to heart, understand, conceptaulize.  In one corner the Unix Commands have set up camp next to the boundaries, they refer to our need to network and use the word based iterm$ that is alternately fascinating and destructive to every thought I have ever had about computers.  Drag and drop does not apply.  Point and click is a dead end.  It’s time to type, fast and correctly, which apparently is a skill I no longer possess.</p>

    			<p>Problem solving is fun.</p>  
			    	<p>The little bits that you miss.  An e instead of an i, a semi-colon, and random missing parenthesis.  How long do you search for that missing bracket before you give up, how much frustration is too much frustration.  Do you run with it or do you let it devour you?  Do you find it enlightening or destructive?  As we move farther and deeper into the understanding of the jargon laced context of the world we have chosen to inhabit, this consumes the mind.  This is the detail.  The keystroke gone awry, the constant reminder that a computer does not live in a self-correcting internal environment.  Homeostasis is for water based life.  Crystalline structures need order solidity, rules, static everywhere.</p> 

					<p>Most days eventually you get tired of all the shining pixels.  The sand lifts off the floor and settles in the corner of your eyes, it grinds down, it filters into your hands it glitters and slides agianst the ends of your fingertips and all you want to do is go outside, breath in the sunshine fluttered air and climb up higher than the building you’ve been trapped in all day.  This will free you, but it comes at a price.  You must come back down and open the door once agian.</p>

    				<p>		This is where it all fell down.</p>  
			    	<p>		  Why was it hard, don’t know.  It’s hard to know what you need to know when you don’t know.  There is an issue, yeh, but with what? The general concept you are trying to think of, the possibility that that concept doesn’t exist.  With the limited knowledge that you have available, you want to solve the problem.  More than want, almost need too.  But how? </p>
					<p>		Then it suddenly makes sense and you don't know why or what you did or how you did it.  It's exhilarating and infuriating at the same time.</p>

  					<p>		There is an engine inside us that produces, by the millisecond, ideas that restructure light. </p>
    				<p>		 In this way, we can live, the tables we sit at; the walls of our houses.</p>  
			    	<p>		   These things only exist because light exists.  Each burning ring of hydrogen bends around us, shatters into little blips and us; in our simple way, we align them.  Columns, rows, little boxes filled with light.  little boxes, little boxes all sitting on the hill and they’re all made out of ticky-tacky and they all look just the same.  </p>

  			</div>
  			<div class="panel-body">
  					<p>		Networking is an automatic cringe.  Maybe some people like it but I cannot understand why.  It's basically just talking to people  which we all do every day but call it networking suddenly the fear gains a life of it's own inside the mind.  Every tiny, consistent social error that thoughts progress towards, every simple motion of the hand now seems to curve in slow motion.  Reiterating your own stupidity, your inability to adjust or adapt.  </p>
    				<p>		 And then there are the acryonyms;  PHP, do you use PHP?  Your backend is a legacy system right; the jargon;  Cobalt?  What about Cobalt?  Our ORM is getting switched over to Mongoose and how about that OLAP?</p>  
			    	<p>		   There is a way in which coding is like the military.  A cultish acryonym based language that feeds on itself, building into wave of information, tall as a small building and as wide as the horizon.  You can't escape it, you can't adjust it, just swim out and surf.  </p>
			    	<p>		  Take a minute to understand what you are saying and you will find yourself tumbling, rolling under the roiling water.  Lost as a puppy in the woods, sleek silver bodied wolves trotting close by, golden eyes half-mooned agianst the brilliant bruise of sky.</p>
			    	<p>		  I'll take the scared puppy any day.  A quick clean shake and the world goes black.  It's gotta be better than networking with acryonyms.</p>
